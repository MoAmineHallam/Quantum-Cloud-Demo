# Quantum Computing and Cloud Services Demonstrations

This repository showcases experiments in quantum computing using cloud platforms, including:

- IBM Quantum Cloud – Python experiments using Qiskit.

- Azure Quantum – Q# experiments demonstrating Bell states.

The goal is to demonstrate cloud-based quantum computing workflows, comparing simulator and hardware results, and providing reproducible steps for anyone to try.

For detailed instructions, code, and results, see the section-specific READMEs:

- [IBM Quantum Section](IBM_Quantum_BellState/README.md)  
- [Azure Q# Section](Azure_QSharp_BellState/README.md)
